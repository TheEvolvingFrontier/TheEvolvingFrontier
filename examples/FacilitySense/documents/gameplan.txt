Frontend:

use html/css/javascript. minimalist aestethic. focus on funcationality and style in order.

Backend:

Use Flask and therefore python. deploy to heroku, possibly somewhere else as a contingency plan if we run into troble with sending emails form heroku. We will start with the code from the Smile project and build upon it.
